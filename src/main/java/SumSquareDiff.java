 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 − 385 = 2640.
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
